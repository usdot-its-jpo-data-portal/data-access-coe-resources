Introduction
This document provides guidelines for creating a Data Management Plan (DMP) to make it easier for projects to prepare their DMP using a consistent format. These instructions are based off of the United States Department of Transportation’s (U.S. DOT’s) National Transportation Library’s Guidance for Creating Data Management Plans for Extramural Research, and provide additional clarification for U.S. DOT’s expectations for DMPs. These instructions inform applicants of elements the U.S. DOT would like to see in a DMP, but do not serve as an approved government form or template. Applicants should use their best judgement in determining what information to include and if additional information should be incorporated into the DMP.

The Data Management Plan (DMP) is a living document describing how researchers will handle digital data both during and after a research project, and how the research proposal conforms to U.S. DOT policy on the dissemination and sharing of research results. The DMP should adequately identify the data to be collected, how the data will further the goals of the U.S. DOT, how the data will be made accessible, how the data will be stored, and in what standard(s) the data will use. .

A preliminary DMP with Project Overview, Data Overview, and Data Stewardship section details must be created for the proposal phase of a research project. It is important to note that projects applying and receiving funding from ITS JPO are required to submit DMPs when applying for funding (a preliminary DMP) and after award (a post-award DMP).  The preliminary DMP will evolve into the post-award DMP, and should be updated regularly to capture pertinent changes to a project's data management procedure and/or data, including schema changes.

Please detail which data require controlled-access, reasons for controlling access to data, and methods taken to safeguard these data.
Controlled-access is defined as restricting access to certain groups of persons due to data containing personally identifiable information (PII), information that threatens privacy of an individual or group, information that threatens confidentiality of a person or group, and/or contains confidential business information (CBI). 
Suggested elements for this section include, but are not limited to:
3.2.1	Can all of the data from this project be shared with the public, or is controlled-access required for at least some of the data?
•	Public Access: If there is no data requiring controlled-access, select the ‘Public Access’ checkbox. 
•	Controlled-Access: If there is data in one or more datasets requiring controlled-access (e.g. Personally Identifiable Information [PII] or Confidential Business Information [CBI]) select the ‘Controlled-Access’ checkbox.
3.2.2	Datasets Requiring Controlled-Access
This section is only required if “Controlled-Access” is selected for Section 4.2.1. 
•	In this section, list all datasets that require controlled-access and why the datasets require controlled-access. Please provide all elements for each anticipated dataset that requires controlled-access. Dataset Title: Provide the dataset title.
•	Reasons for Controlled-Access: For any data requiring controlled-access, please detail why the data requires controlled-access. 
•	Safeguarding Methods and Processes: Describe the methods and processes that are taken to safeguard the data requiring controlled-access, such as redacting data before providing public access to the dataset. Please elaborate on the specific methods, for example blurring license plates in videos, geofencing sensor data, removing persistent IDs, etc. Any privacy, ethical or confidentiality concerns raised due to data sharing should be described.
3.2.3	Informed Consent
If your project contains human subject research, please describe how informed consent forms permit sharing with the research community and whether additional steps, such as an Institutional Review Board (IRB) are used to protect privacy and confidentiality. 
3.2.4	Access Requests
For each dataset, describe what processes you follow to allow full access to this data if requested, including criteria a user must pass to gain this access (e.g. for a specific business purpose, if the user is a part of a certain user group, a member of the research team, etc.).
3.2.5	Relevant Privacy and/or Security Agreements
If applicable, for each dataset provide a list of relevant privacy and/or security agreements (e.g., non-disclosure agreements, rules of behavior, memoranda of understanding, confidentiality agreements, sub-contracts, etc.) that apply to these data and its users, including circumstances when these agreements would be used.
3.3	Re-Use, Redistribution, and Derivative Products Policies
The U.S. DOT is interested in who holds the intellectual property right(s) for the research project data, whether these rights will transfer to a data archive, whether any copyrights apply to the data, and other aspects that apply to the rights to use the data. Please provide details on these elements in this section.
In accordance with the OPEN Government Data Act, to the extent practicable, data must be made available through an open license that is available at no cost to the public and with no restrictions on copying, publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing or adapting such asset. In this section, please provide the applicable licenses for each dataset and specify if an open license will be used. If the project is U.S. DOT-funded, an open license should be used for the dataset, unless otherwise restricted by controlled access. If a non-open license is used for this data, include a justification for why a non-open license is used.
Suggested elements for this section include, but are not limited to:
•	Dataset Title: Please provide the title of the dataset(s) that use this license.
•	License Used: List the license that is used for this/these dataset(s) (e.g. Creative Commons – BY version X.0) and provide a URL (or several) with more information on the license. Specify whether the license is an open license or a non-open license. An “’open license’ means a legal guarantee that a data asset is made available (A) at no cost to the public and (B) with no restrictions on copying publishing, distributing, transmitting, citing or adapting such asset. ” A non-open license does not adhere to all of the open license criteria. 
•	Reasons for a Non-Open License: If a non-open license is used for a dataset, provide the reason for using a non-open license.
3.4	Data Storage and Retention
Storing and retaining the data is a key part of the data steward’s responsibilities to manage, control, and maintain the quality of a data asset throughout the data lifecycle. 
In this section, list all of the data storage systems that are used to store the research project’s data, provide details on those data systems, and specify how long the data will be stored in each system.
A public access system provides full data access to the public. A controlled-access system restricts access to certain groups of persons due to data containing personally identifiable information (PII), information that threatens privacy of an individual or group, information that threatens confidentiality of a person or group, and/or contains confidential business information (CBI).  An applicant system is managed by the applicant, a U.S. DOT system is managed by the U.S. DOT, and a third-party system is a system that is managed by a person, group or organization other than the U.S. DOT or the applicant.
Suggested elements for this section include, but are not limited to:
